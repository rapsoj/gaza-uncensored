10-year-old Mais Abdel Aal
She was playing inside her tent when she was struck by a bullet from a drone. The bullet penetrated her skull, causing partial paralysis, nerve damage, and loss of vision.
A portion of her skull had to be removed, and since then, she has been suffering from severe complications: the wound remains open, infections are frequent, and seizures persist.
Just days ago, doctors discovered worms inside the wound, forcing them to reopen her skull under extremely limited medical conditions.
Mais is in constant pain, and her condition is deteriorating by the day.
She urgently needs immediate medical treatment abroad - every minute of delay puts her life at serious risk.
