Urgent Humanitarian Appeal to Save Ghadeer
Ghadeer, a 30-year-old mother of three, was severely injured in the recent attacks on Gaza.
She has lost her left leg and suffers from serious damage to her right leg, with a real risk of losing it too if she doesn't receive urgent and advanced medical care abroad.
Ghadeer is not only fighting pain-she's fighting to stand again, to care for her children, to live with dignity.
We appeal to all compassionate hearts and humanitarian organizations: act now to help save her leg, her future, her motherhood.
