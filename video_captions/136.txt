Taysir Mansour (17 years old) suffered severe second-degree burns after an Israeli airstrike targeted his family.
His condition is critical, and he faces the risk of losing both hands after more than eight failed skin graft and reconstructive surgeries.
His injuries have worsened due to severe infections and joint stiffness.
For the past nine months, Taysir has been receiving inadequate treatment at Nasser Hospital under the care of Doctors Without Borders.
His condition continues to deteriorate due to the lack of proper medication and medical resources.
Taysir is not alone-his entire family suffered burns, and his mother died from her injuries. Now, Taysir, the eldest, is the only provider for his family, but he is helpless and at risk of losing both hands.
Taysir urgently needs treatment abroad.
Save his hands, save his life, save his future.
