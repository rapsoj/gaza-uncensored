Urgent Humanitarian Appeal | Child: Osama Al-Ruqab
Osama Al-Ruqab, a young child, is suffering from chronic diarrhea, recurrent chest infections, and severe malnutrition.
According to doctors, Osama urgently needs genetic testing abroad to diagnose his condition - yet, until now, his case has not been referred for treatment outside Gaza.
Osama's health continues to deteriorate. He has been prescribed a special diet rich in fats, proteins, and high-calorie foods such as meat, chicken, nuts, cheese, and oils.
However, due to the closure of border crossings and the severe shortage of food supplies, his family is unable to secure the nutrition he desperately needs.
