Urgent Appeal to Save the Life of Baby Maryam in Gaza
Maryam is a two-year-old girl who used to weigh 10 kilograms - today, she weighs only 4. She suffers from an enlarged liver, kidneys, and spleen, as well as a severe drop in blood levels (hemoglobin at 4). Her condition is critical and she urgently needs medical treatment outside the Gaza Strip.
Maryam's father holds official medical reports and approval from the World Health Organization. All he asks is for your help to get her out of Gaza so she can receive life-saving treatment abroad.
